Dear %%first_name%%,

The recently passed Texas School Finance law (House Bill 3) includes sweeping changes across the education landscape, especially in special education and dyslexia instruction. Teachers who understand the science of reading and have access to materials that follow the structured literacy approach can help struggling students find literacy success, even those with dyslexia or other reading disorders.
Learn how our programs, which follow the principles of structured literacy, give teachers the support they need to help every student become a proficient reader.
